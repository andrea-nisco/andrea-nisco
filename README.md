# Andrea Nisco - Software Engineer

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hello! I'm Andrea, a 24-year-old software engineering master's student at the Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, with a bachelor's degree from the University of Benevento (UniversitÃ  del Sannio). My passion for technology drives me to explore diverse projects, ranging from cybersecurity solutions to mobile app and game development. When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying video games, spending time with my cats, or savoring a good cup of coffee.

## ðŸš€ Current Project: Deception Generator Component
My primary focus is on the "Deception Generator Component," a sophisticated system designed to create dummy data for deceiving cyber attacks. This project, pivotal in my career, incorporates technologies like Docker, Postgres, and Keycloak on a Linux platform. It epitomizes my ability to innovate in the realm of cybersecurity.

## ðŸ’¡ Other Projects
I'm also actively involved in two personal projects:

Developing a mobile application.
Creating a video game using Unity.
These projects allow me to hone my skills in software design and development further.
